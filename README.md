How to use!
1.run the program
2.It is going to run on local host 3000/cats
http://localhost:3000/cats
3.methodes you can use
Get: returns the array of cats
Post: Creates a new cat in the array. needs name age and breed 
Put: updates an existing cat in the array using the name
Delete: deletes an existing cat in the array using the name

How I ran/tested the program. I used a program called Postman to carry out all the actions
make sure when using any of the last three (Post/Put/Delete) you have it set to Body and x-www-form-urlencoded 
for using a cat object otherwise nothing will return

additional notes. I hope I did what you asked. It did say option one/two so I assumed it was pick one.
Took a little longer then I expected but It was a really fun and interesting experiance learning how to use nest and its functions but I do feel I understand it a lot better after this.
I would have added more but again ran out of time, should not have started with trying to implement SQL right at the start and instead got the base working then add it. 
thanks again for the opportunity!!
